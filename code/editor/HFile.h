 * 6     3/22/99 6:26p Matt
 * Cleaned up error handling in cfile and editor level loads.
 *

 * Added option to show level stats
 * 
 * 4     9/17/97 11:21a Matt
 * Ripped out segment code
 * 
 * 6     4/01/97 11:00p Matt
 * Changed editor to keep a viewer object (type camera) seperate from the
 * player object.  This camera, and not the player, is now moved by
 * slewing, the C key, etc.  When going into the game, the viewer position
 * & orientation are copied to the player.  When going back to the editor,
 * the player position is copied to the viewer, and the player object is
 * reset to its start location.
 * 
 * 5     3/04/97 7:13p Samir
 * Added prototype to move player object to segment, side.  This should
 * probably be moved to another file.

 * 4     2/20/97 9:56a Matt
 * Moved some general-purpose segment code from HFile.cpp to ESegments.cpp
 *
